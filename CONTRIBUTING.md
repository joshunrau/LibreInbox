# Contributions Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to LibreInbox! Your efforts can help improve the software for everyone. This guide outlines the steps and best practices for contributing.

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with Git and GitHub.
2. Basic understanding of the project's architecture and coding standards.

## Steps to Contribute

### 1. Communication

- **Minor Changes**: For small improvements or bug fixes, feel free to fork the repository and submit a PR directly.

- **Major Features**: If you're considering a large contribution, please get in touch with us first. This way, we can provide feedback and ensure your time is well spent. It also helps to avoid potential overlaps with other contributors.

### 2. Fork the Repository

Begin by forking the repository to your personal GitHub account. This will give you a separate copy of the codebase where you can make your changes.

### 3. Create a New Branch

Never work directly on the `main` branch. Instead, create a new branch for your feature or fix. This keeps the project organized and makes the integration of changes smoother. 

```shell
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```

### 4. Committing Changes

Ensure your commits are clear and understandable. If possible, follow a convention like:

```shell
git commit -m "type: brief description of change"
```

Where `type` can be `feature`, `fix`, `doc`, etc.

### 5. Syncing your Fork

Before submitting your PR, ensure that your fork is up-to-date with the main repository to minimize merge conflicts.

```shell
git pull upstream main
```

### 6. Push Changes to GitHub

Once you're ready and have tested your changes, push your branch to GitHub:

```shell
git push origin your-feature-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Go to your fork on GitHub and click the **"New pull request"** button. Ensure you provide a clear title and description for your PR. This helps maintainers understand and review your contribution.

## Final Notes

- Please adhere to the code standards and practices established in the project.
- Remember to comment on particularly complex sections of code.
- If possible, add tests for new features to ensure they function as expected.
